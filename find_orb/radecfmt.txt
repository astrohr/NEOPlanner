   By default,  RA/decs in ephemerides are shown to 0.001 second in
RA and 0.01 arcsec in declination.  That will usually be good enough
for anybody.  But you can select a higher precision in this menu,
or choose to have output in decimal degrees.  Or you can have the
RA be in decimal hours and declination in decimal degrees;  some people
in the radio astronomy community use this.

   If you don't see the format or precision you want,  you can add
other formats to the menu.  For this,  edit the file 'efindorb.txt'
and look for lines starting with 2054.  You will see the entries for
this menu,  preceded by pairs of numbers.  Those pairs of numbers
specify the RA and dec format,  respectively.  Documentation of which
numbers go with which format is in the file 'environ.def'; look for
the lines concerning RA_DEC_FORMAT.  You can add or remove the 2054
lines freely.
