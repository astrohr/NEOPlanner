   If a file contains astrometry for more than one object,  Find_Orb will
list them.  If there's sufficient room on-screen,  it may list a bit of
information about that object (number of observations and time range).

   Double-click on an object,  or move the highlighted object with the
cursor keys and hit Enter or Space,  and Find_Orb will load astrometry
for that object.

   If you have a _lot_ of objects in the file,  you can just type the
object's name to find it (or type a few letters/numbers to go to that
part of the list.)
