# You should change the name and e-mail address,  and probably the
# comment,  too.  Then rename this to 'link_hdr.json'.  Find_Orb
# will use that instead of the default 'link_def.json'.  (And when
# you update,  your name and e-mail won't get overwritten.)
#    Please leave the %t and %v somewhere in the header.  Find_Orb
# will replace them with the time the linkage was written and the
# Find_Orb version date,  both of which may help in puzzling out any
# bugs or mangled linkage files.
