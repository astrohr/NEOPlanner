You can enter almost any 'standard' MPC designation or name,  including
packed variants.  For example,  any of

Apophis
99942
2004 MN4
K04M04N

would get astrometry for (99942) Apophis = 2004 MN4.  Similarly,
any of the following three entries would get astrometry for
P/2005 L4 = 286P Christensen.

P/2005 L4
286P
PK05L040
