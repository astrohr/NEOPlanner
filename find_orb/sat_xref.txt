# I'm keeping track of a lot of junk lacking official COSPAR (YYYY-NNNletter)
# and NORAD (five-digit,  eventually to be nine-digit) identifiers.  The
# following gives my unofficial IDs for such objects.  'eph2tle' uses these
# to set both identifiers.  Eventually,  'sat_id' may use it as well.
# 2021 Dec 16 version.  Comments can be added freely if starting with #.

# I started with 89999 and worked backward.  The amateur tracking community
# uses numbers starting with 90000;  in recent years,  Space-Track has had
# 'analyst' objects starting with 80000. For COSPAR,  I've started with
# 00000AAA and went up.

# In a few cases,  objects appear under multiple names,  either because I
# made an identification later (00000AAQ,  for example) or just messed up
# (00000AAU,  for example).
