   Click on the '?' or hit '?' for more help.  Here's the short version :

   Find_Orb can import astrometric data from a file,  or from the clipboard.
Or you can enter a designation and Find_Orb will download the observational
data from the MPC.
$000000
   Observations can be in the MPC's 80-column format,  or PSV ADES,  or XML
ADES,  or the .rwo format.  You can mix these freely.  For details,  see

https://projectpluto.com/astromet.htm

   for details on what formats this program will accept.

   If the input has data on one object,  that data will immediately be read
and an orbit calculated.  If it has data for two or more objects,  you'll
be able to select the one in which you're interested.

   Click on "Give object name and get data from MPC",  and you'll be asked
to enter a name/designation such as Ceres,  2014 AA, C/1986 A1, etc.  Find_Orb
will then attempt to download the astrometry for that object from the MPC.
